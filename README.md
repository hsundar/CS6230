Template code for CS6230 Assignments

Students should check out this repository and add a folder under students named
after their uid. All code should be within this folder.

You can use the 'build.py' script to compile and test your code. 

The options are,

```bash
$ python build.py compile Reduce.c int sum # will compile Reduce.c under students/uxxxxxxx/ and run test cases if compilation is successful
$ build.py archive    # will generate the zip file for submission
```
