Template code for CS6230 Assignments

Students should check out this repository and add a folder under students named
after their uid. All code should be within this folder.

You can use the 'build.py' script to compile and test your code. 

The options are,

```bash
# will compile Reduce.c under students/uxxxxxxx/ and run test cases if compilation is successful where datatype is int and operation is sum
$ python build.py compile Reduce.c int sum 
# will generate the zip file for submission
$ build.py archive    
```
